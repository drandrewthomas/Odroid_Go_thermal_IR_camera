# Odroid Go thermal infrared camera

## Introduction

This is a simple IR (infrared) thermal camera project for the Odroid Go handheld ESP32 system. It allows saving of data to an SD card as well as having a basic Bluetooth interface to wirelessly get data off the camera to a computer, tablet or mobile phone. It's based on the MLX90640 32x24 pixel infrared thermal array modules that you can get relatively inexpensively many laces online. Below is a photo of it in action.
